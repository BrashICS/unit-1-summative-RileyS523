    <h1>Eniac, Edvac and Univac</h1>
    <p> 
      Take a walk with me through the History of Computersâ„¢, starting with the Eniac, made in 1945 it was the first digital computer of its size and power at the time. Made to calculate the equations for the Hydrogen Bomb. After the Eniac was discontinued in 1955 in favour of the Edvac, which was finalized in 1952. Edvac was in use for 10 years, up until the 1962. Univac was also a successor to the Eniac, finished and finalized in 1951
