    <h1>Historical signifacants of the Edvac</h1>
    <p> 
      Edvac is important for a few reasons, one of which is that it was a successor to the Eniac, finally finished in 1952, many called in "obsolete" because of the other, better technology around at the time. It was in use until 1962, 10 years of work despite being "obsolete". There are more sources that I have yet to find, but my boss said I have a time limit so I will leave it at that.
